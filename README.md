# RPA User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with UiPath

## Overview

Testing plays a vital role in the development of any solution, ensuring that it meets user requirements and performs as expected. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a critical milestone in the development process, serving as the final decision point before a solution is deployed into production. UAT focuses on validating that the input provided to a system generates the desired output. If the solution fails to meet these expectations, it must be revised and retested until it meets the required standards.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) leverages technology to automate tasks by simulating human actions, particularly in the context of front-end or User Interface (UI) automation. RPA is especially valuable for automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, freeing up human resources to work on more complex and creative endeavors.

In this project, we explore how UiPath, an RPA platform, can be used to automate user acceptance testing for a web application. Instead of manually entering data and validating output, an RPA solution can perform these tasks, significantly improving efficiency and reducing human error.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- **UiPath Automation Cloud Account**: Create an account on UiPath Automation Cloud for orchestrating and monitoring your RPA workflows.

- **UiPath Studio Community Edition**: Download and install UiPath Studio Community Edition on your computer, which you will use to design and create your RPA automation workflows.

- **Access to the Web Application**: You must have access to the web application on which you plan to perform UI automation. Ensure that the application is available for testing.

- **Test Data**: Obtain the Excel file containing the test data, which will serve as the input for your UI automation and validation of the RPA solution's output.

## Implementation Options

For this project, a web application has been provided as the target for UI automation testing. You can access the web application at the following URL: [https://cmpg323-ecopowerlogistics.azurewebsites.net/](https://cmpg323-ecopowerlogistics.azurewebsites.net/). It's important to note that this web application is specifically set up for this project.

Please be aware that you are responsible for adapting and configuring the UiPath solution to work with this web application. There is no access to Azure resources or databases associated with the application. The primary focus here is on RPA implementation for testing purposes.

## Requirements

In any software project, defining both functional and non-functional requirements is essential to ensure that the solution aligns with needs and quality standards. Here's a brief overview of these requirements:

### Functional Requirements

- **UI Automation**: The RPA solution must automate interaction with the web application, including data input and validation of expected output.

- **Test Data Integration**: The solution should be capable of integrating test data from an Excel file into the web application.

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected situations or errors during automation.

- **Reporting**: Provide a mechanism for reporting on the success or failure of each test case, offering clear insights into the testing results.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reliability**: The RPA solution must consistently produce accurate testing results.

- **Efficiency**: The automation should save time and resources compared to manual testing.

- **Scalability**: The solution should be adaptable to various test cases and potentially other web applications.

- **Usability**: Ensure that the RPA workflow is user-friendly and easily understandable for team members involved in testing.

- **Maintainability**: Document the RPA solution and implement version control to ensure its maintainability.

Remember to document and manage these requirements as you develop and deploy your UiPath RPA solution for user acceptance testing.
